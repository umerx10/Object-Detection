# YOLO Object Detection 

##  Overview
This is a simple implementation of **YOLOv5** for object detection using PyTorch.  
The model detects common objects (from the COCO dataset) in images, videos, or webcam streams.  

##  Features
- Detects 80+ objects (person, car, dog, chair, etc.)
- Works with images, videos, or live webcam
- Saves detection results automatically
- Uses YOLOv5 pretrained model (`yolov5s`)
